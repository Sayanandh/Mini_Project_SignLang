# ASL Recognition using PyTorch

This project is designed to recognize **American Sign Language (ASL)** gestures using a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) implemented in **PyTorch**. The model is trained on a dataset of ASL images and can classify gestures into 35 categories (A-Z, space, del, and nothing).

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to build a deep learning model that can recognize ASL gestures from images. The model is trained on a dataset of ASL images and uses a custom CNN architecture. The project includes:
- Data preprocessing and augmentation.
- A custom CNN model implemented in PyTorch.
- Training and evaluation scripts.
- Support for GPU acceleration.

---

## Features
- **Custom CNN Architecture**: A deep CNN model with multiple convolutional and fully connected layers.
- **Data Augmentation**: Image transformations like resizing, normalization, and random augmentations to improve model generalization.
- **GPU Support**: Utilizes CUDA for GPU acceleration (if available).
- **Early Stopping**: Prevents overfitting by stopping training when validation loss stops improving.
- **Progress Bar**: Displays training progress using `tqdm`.
